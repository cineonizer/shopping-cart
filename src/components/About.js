        A diamond is made up of just one kind of atom, many times over: carbon.
        Its complete chemical formula is exquisitely simple: C. Yet, as a matter
        of chemical fact, the same carbon atoms, differently arranged, yield not
        a sparkling diamond, but gray pencil lead.
        <br />
        <br />
        The diamond is in the details.
